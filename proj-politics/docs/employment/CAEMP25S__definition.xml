<TABLE_DEFINITIONS Table="CAEMP25S" Name="Total Full-Time and Part-Time Employment by SIC Industry" Source="USDOC/BEA/RD"><LINE><Code>10</Code><Description>Total employment (number of jobs)</Description><Definition>A count of jobs, both full-time and part-time. It includes wage and salary jobs, sole proprietorships, and individual general partners, but not unpaid family workers nor volunteers.</Definition></LINE><LINE><Code>20</Code><Description>Wage and salary employment</Description><Definition>Wage and salary employment, also referred to as wage and salary jobs, measures the average annual number of full-time and part-time jobs in each area by place of work. All jobs for which wages and salaries are paid are counted. Although compensation paid to jurors, expert legal witnesses, prisoners, and justices of the peace (for marriage fees), is counted in wages and salaries, these activities are not counted as jobs in wage and salary employment. Corporate directorships are counted as self-employment. The following description of the sources and methods used in estimating wage and salary employment is divided into two sections: Employment in industries covered by unemployment insurance (UI) programs, and employment in industries not covered by UI.</Definition></LINE><LINE><Code>40</Code><Description>Proprietors employment</Description><Definition>Consists of farm proprietors employment and nonfarm proprietors employment.</Definition></LINE><LINE><Code>50</Code><Description>Farm proprietors employment</Description><Definition>Consists of sole proprietors and non-corporate partners in the farm industry.</Definition></LINE><LINE><Code>60</Code><Description>Nonfarm proprietors employment</Description><Definition>Consists of the number of nonfarm sole proprietorships and the number of individual general partners in nonfarm partnerships.</Definition></LINE><LINE><Code>70</Code><Description>Farm employment</Description><Definition>Farm employment is the number of workers engaged in the direct production of agricultural commodities, either livestock or crops; whether as a sole proprietor, partner, or hired laborer.</Definition></LINE><LINE><Code>80</Code><Description>Nonfarm employment</Description><Definition>Nonfarm employment consists of nonfarm wage and salary employment and nonfarm proprietors employment. Nonfarm proprietors employment consist of the number of sole proprietorships and the number of individual general partners in partnerships. The nonfarm proprietors employment estimates resemble the wage and salary employment estimates in that both series measure jobs-as opposed to workers-on a full-time and part-time basis. However, because of limitations in source data, two important measurement differences exist between the two sets of estimates. First, the nonfarm proprietors employment estimates are largely on a place-of-residence basis rather than on the preferred place-of-work basis. Second, the nonfarm proprietors employment estimates reflect the total number of sole proprietorships or individual general partners active at any time during the year-as opposed to the annual average measure used for wage and salary employment.</Definition></LINE><LINE><Code>90</Code><Description>Private nonfarm employment</Description><Definition>Private nonfarm employment is the sum of wage and salary employment and nonfarm proprietors employment, excluding farm and government.</Definition></LINE><LINE><Code>100</Code><Description>Agricultural services, forestry, and fishing</Description><Definition>This SIC division includes establishments primarily engaged in agricultural services, forestry, commercial fishing, hunting, trapping, and related services.The classification of agricultural services includes establishments primarily engaged in supplying soil preparation services, crop services, veterinary services, other animal services, farm labor and management services, and landscape and horticultural services, for others on a contract or fee basis.The classification of forestry covers establishments primarily engaged in the operation of timber tracts, tree farms, forest nurseries, and related activities such as the gathering of gums, barks, balsam needles, maple sap, Spanish moss, and other forest products. Logging establishments are classified in Manufacturing, Industry 2411.The classification of fishing, hunting, and trapping covers establishments primarily engaged in commercial fishing (including crabbing, lobstering, clamming, oystering, and the gathering of sponges and seaweed), and the operation of fish hatcheries and fish and game preserves, in commercial hunting and trapping, and in game propagation.</Definition></LINE><LINE><Code>200</Code><Description>Mining</Description><Definition>This SIC division includes all establishments primarily engaged in mining. The term mining is used in the broad sense to include the extraction of minerals occurring naturally: solids, such as coal and ores; liquids, such as crude petroleum; and gases such as natural gas. The term mining is also used in the broad sense to include quarrying, well operations, milling (e.g., crushing, screening, washing, flotation), and other preparation customarily done at the mine site, or as a part of mining activity. Exploration and development of mineral properties are included. Services performed on a contract or fee basis in the development or operation of mineral properties are classified separately but within this division. Establishments which have complete responsibility for operating mines, quarries, or oil and gas wells for others on a contract or fee basis are classified according to the product mined rather than as mineral services.</Definition></LINE><LINE><Code>300</Code><Description>Construction</Description><Definition>The term "Construction" is used in both the SIC system and in NAICS, but it does not have the same definition in both systems. SIC definition:This SIC division includes establishments primarily engaged in construction. The term construction includes new work, additions, alterations, reconstruction, installations, and repairs. Construction activities are generally administered or managed from a relatively fixed place of business, but the actual construction work is performed at one or more different sites. If a company has more than one relatively fixed place of business from which it undertakes or manages construction activities and for which separate data on the number of employees, payroll, receipts, and other establishment-type records are maintained, each such place of business is considered a separate construction establishment. Three broad types of construction activity are covered: (1) building construction by general contractors or by operative builders; (2) heavy construction other than building by general contractors and special trade contractors; and (3) construction activity by other special trade contractors. NAICS definition:The Construction (NAICS) sector comprises establishments primarily engaged in the construction of buildings or engineering projects (e.g., highways an utility systems). Establishments primarily engaged in the preparation of sites for new construction and establishments primarily engaged in subdividing land for sale as building sites also are included in this sector. Construction work done may include new work, additions, alterations, or maintenance and repairs. Activities of these establishments generally are managed at a fixed place of business, but they usually perform construction activities at multiple project sites. Production responsibilities in this sector are usually specified in (1) contracts with the owners of construction projects (prime contracts) or (2) contracts with other construction establishments (subcontracts).</Definition></LINE><LINE><Code>400</Code><Description>Manufacturing</Description><Definition>The term "Manufacturing" is used in both the SIC system and in NAICS, but it does not have the same definition in both systems. SIC definition:The manufacturing SIC division includes establishments engaged in the mechanical or chemical transformation of materials or substances into new products. These establishments are usually described as plants, factories, or mills and characteristically use power driven machines and materials handling equipment. Establishments engaged in assembling component parts of manufactured products are also considered manufacturing if the new product is neither a structure nor other fixed improvement. Also included is the blending of materials, such as lubricating oils, plastics resins, or liquors. NAICS definition:The Manufacturing NAICS sector comprises establishments engaged in the mechanical, physical, or chemical transformation of materials, substances, or components into new products. The assembling of component parts of manufactured products is considered manufacturing, except in cases where the activity is appropriately classified in Sector 23, Construction. Establishments in the Manufacturing sector are often described as plants, factories, or mills and characteristically use power-driven machines and materials-handling equipment. However, establishments that transform materials or substances into new products by hand or in the worker's home and those engaged in selling to the general public products made on the same premises from which they are sold, such as bakeries, candy stores, and custom tailors, may also be included in this sector. Manufacturing establishments may process materials or may contract with other establishments to process their materials for them. Both types of establishments are included in manufacturing.</Definition></LINE><LINE><Code>500</Code><Description>Transportation and public utilities</Description><Definition>This SIC division includes establishments providing, to the general public or to other business enterprises, passenger and freight transportation, communications services, or electricity, gas, steam, water or sanitary services. For many of the industries in this division, the establishments have activities, workers, and physical facilities distributed over an extensive geographic area. For this division, the establishment is represented by a relatively permanent office, shop, station, terminal, or warehouse, etc. that is either (1) directly responsible for supervising such activities or (2) the base from which personnel operate to carry out these activities. This division is referred to as "Transportation, Communications, Electric, Gas, and Sanitary Services" in the Standard Industrial Classification Manual.</Definition></LINE><LINE><Code>610</Code><Description>Wholesale trade</Description><Definition>The term "wholesale trade" is used in the SIC system and in NAICS, but it does not have the same definition in both systems. SIC definition:This SIC division includes establishments or places of business primarily engaged in selling merchandise to retailers; to industrial, commercial, institutional, farm, construction contractors, or professional business users; or to other wholesalers; or acting as agents or brokers in buying merchandise for or selling merchandise to such persons or companies. NAICS definition:The Wholesale Trade NAICS sector comprises establishments engaged in wholesaling merchandise, generally without transformation, and rendering services incidental to the sale of merchandise. The merchandise described in this sector includes the outputs of agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and certain information industries, such as publishing.</Definition></LINE><LINE><Code>620</Code><Description>Retail trade</Description><Definition>The term "retail trade" is used in the SIC system and in NAICS, but it does not have the same definition in both systems. SIC definition:This SIC division includes establishments engaged in selling merchandise for personal or household consumption and rendering services incidental to the sale of the goods. In general, retail establishments are classified by kind of business according to the principal lines of commodities sold (groceries, hardware, etc.), or the usual trade designation (drug store, cigar store, etc.). Some of the important characteristics of retail trade establishments are: the establishment is usually a place of business and is engaged in activities to attract the general public to buy; the establishment buys or receives merchandise as well as sells; the establishment may process its products, but such processing is incidental or subordinate to selling; the establishment is considered as retail in the trade; and the establishment sells to customers for personal or household use. Not all of these characteristics need be present and some are modified by trade practice. NAICS definition:The Retail Trade NAICS sector comprises establishments engaged in retailing merchandise, generally without transformation, and rendering services incidental to the sale of merchandise. The retailing process is the final step in the distribution of merchandise; retailers are, therefore, organized to sell merchandise in small quantities to the general public. This sector comprises two main types of retailers: store and nonstore retailers. 1. Store retailers operate fixed point-of-sale locations, located and designed to attract a high volume of walk-in customers. In general, retail stores have extensive displays of merchandise and use mass-media advertising to attract customers. They typically sell merchandise to the general public for personal or household consumption, but some also serve business and institutional clients. These include establishments, such as office supply stores, computer and software stores, building materials dealers, plumbing supply stores, and electrical supply stores. Catalog showrooms, gasoline stations, automotive dealers, and mobile home dealers are treated as store retailers. In addition to retailing merchandise, some types of store retailers are also engaged in the provision of after-sales services, such as repair and installation. For example, new automobile dealers, electronic and appliance stores, and musical instrument and supply stores often provide repair services. As a general rule, establishments engaged in retailing merchandise and providing after-sales services are classified in this sector. 2. Nonstore retailers, like store retailers, are organized to serve the general public, but their retailing methods differ. The establishments of this subsector reach customers and market merchandise with methods, such as the broadcasting of "infomercials," the broadcasting and publishing of direct-response advertising, the publishing of paper and electronic catalogs, door-to-door solicitation, in-home demonstration, selling from portable stalls (street vendors, except food), and distribution through vending machines. Establishments engaged in the direct sale (nonstore) of products, such as home heating oil dealers and home delivery newspaper routes are included here.</Definition></LINE><LINE><Code>700</Code><Description>Finance, insurance, and real estate</Description><Definition>This SIC division includes establishments operating primarily in the fields of finance, insurance, and real estate.

The estimates of wages and salaries for the military services consist of cash wages (including allowances) of full-time personnel of the armed services (including the Coast Guard), cash wages of the members of the Reserves including the National Guard, and pay-in-kind received by the full-time and reserve enlisted personnel of the armed services.Military employment is measured as the number of military personnel assigned to active duty units that are stationed in the area plus the number of military reserve unit members. The estimates of active duty employment for the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard are based on the annual averages of 12 monthly observations, for a given year, from reports received from each branch of service. Navy personnel assigned to ships and other mobile units and Marines assigned to Fleet Marine Force units are measured according to the units' home ports rather than their actual locations as of the reporting date. The measure of the employment of the military Reserves--including the National Guard--is confined to members of reserve units that meet regularly for training. The state estimates are based on fiscal year--ending September 30--tabulations of military reserve strength provided by the Department of Defense.</Definition></LINE><LINE><Code>930</Code><Description>State and local</Description><Definition>"State and local" is a sub-group of Government in estimates of GDP, and a sub-group of Government and government enterprises in the personal income and employment estimates.</Definition></LINE><LINE><Code>931</Code><Description>State government</Description><Definition>A sub-group of Government and Government Enterprises.Estimates of government wages and salaries, government earnings, government compensation, and government employment are presented in four pieces: Federal civilian; military; state government; and local government.</Definition></LINE><LINE><Code>932</Code><Description>Local government</Description><Definition>A sub-group of Government and Government Enterprises.Estimates of government wages and salaries, government earnings, government compensation, and government employment are presented in four pieces: Federal civilian; military; state government; and local government.</Definition></LINE></TABLE_DEFINITIONS>
